//This waits until the baseline page is loaded and then gets the JSON feed, and as long as it doesn't error, calls the readdata function to start taking that feed and drawing the HVAC parts. The way it does this is through 'AJAX', which stands for 'Asynchronous JavaScript And XML'. This allows you to go and get data from a server/service (like Google Sheets) after the page has loaded.

/*This is probably your first time seeing options/settings supplied to a JS function with key:value pairs. The syntax for the function is: 
$.ajax({name:value, name:value, ... })
In the example below, 'url' and 'success' are both options. The value for the option is the item that comes after the colon (:), the URL or call back function we want to execute in the case of success.

    //The JSON represents a single sheet in Google Sheets. The model is that the sheet has a table, the table has a series of rows, and those rows have values and then sometimes supplemental items. JS also has built-in facilities to index a JSON scheme where, for example, this statement:
  â€¦partfeed.table.rows[i].c[j].v;
  based on the schema from Google Sheets and the JSON response it got, which is 'partfeed', is able to reference the value of cell in the jth column of the ith row of the table element. There's a pretty good written tutorial on JSON here, if you're interested:
